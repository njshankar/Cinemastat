<p>My name is JJ Shankar, a college student. I created this website a few years ago as a personal project to guide me in my film explorations. It's a simple compilation
 of facts about the filmographies of certain well-known filmmakers, where I've tried to find consensus on what their key works are, and convey this information in an intuitive way. 
 I've found this project to be very helpful for myself, and I hope you will find it helpful too! Most of the photos on this website are 
from Wikimedia commons. For any questions, comments, feedback, or concerns, please email jjillinish@gmail.com.</p>
